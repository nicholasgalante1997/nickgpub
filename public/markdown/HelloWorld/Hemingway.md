# A What's Up To Arms

As with any gradient, a linear gradient has no intrinsic dimensions; i.e., it has no natural or preferred size, nor a preferred ratio. Its concrete size will match the size of the element it applies to.

To create a linear gradient that repeats so as to fill its container, use the gradient/repeating-linear-gradient() function instead.
